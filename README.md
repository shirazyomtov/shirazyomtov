## Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I am Shiraz Yom Tov!

### Main projects
#### HighTeach: A Platform for Connecting Students and Tutors <a href="https://github.com/shirazyomtov/HighTeach"><img src="https://github.com/shirazyomtov/HighTeach/blob/main/static/images/HighTeach_logo.jpeg?raw=true" width="40" alt="HighTeach Logo" style="border-radius: 50%;"></a>
HighTeach is a social network that enables tutors to connect with potential students based on fields or special needs.<br/>
The project was part of the Red Hat Beyond - Open Source Academy course (2023-2023).<br/>
It involved creating an open-source Django web app in Python to facilitate these connections.<br/>

- **Mentored by**: Red Hat
- **Key Features**: Code Reviews, GitHub Integration, Testing (PyTest), Deployment in Linux-based Environments (Vagrant, VirtualBox, Pipenv)
- **GitHub Repository**: [HighTeach repository](https://github.com/shirazyomtov/HighTeach)

#### Predictions: A Virtual World Simulation System
During my third year of computer science, I worked on a project called "Predictions," where we created a system to simulate a virtual "world" with dynamic "laws" that statistically alter entities within it.<br/> The system was highly versatile, supporting various entities and laws, and included multithreading to run multiple simulations in parallel, enhancing efficiency and scalability.

The project evolved through several phases:
- **Console Application**: Developed the core functionality.
- **Desktop Application**: Transitioned to a JavaFX interface for improved user experience.
- **Client-Server Architecture**: Enabled collaborative interaction and simultaneous observation of simulations.

- **GitHub Repository**: [Predictions repository](https://github.com/shirazyomtov/Predictions)
#### Facebook App
The Facebook App provides users with access to their Facebook profiles and the ability to modify them using the Facebook API.<br/>
Built with C# and WinForms as part of a design pattern course at the Academic College of Tel Aviv Yaffo, the app features advanced multithreading and design patterns to ensure optimal performance and scalability.

Key features include:
- **Find My Match**: Helps users find potential romantic matches among their friends by defining preferences and applying matching strategies using the Strategy Pattern.
- **Album Insights**: Offers detailed statistics and sorting of photo albums, utilizing the Template Method Pattern to enhance code maintainability.

Design patterns employed in the app include Factory Method, Facade, Singleton, Strategy, Iterator, and Template Method, each contributing to the app's maintainability, reusability, and extensibility.
